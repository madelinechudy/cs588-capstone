# cs588-capstone

## Dementia Prediction Web App

This project is a web application that predicts Alzheimer's stages using an image of an MRI scan. The backend is built using Flask and TensorFlow, while the frontend is a React-based user interface.

---

## Features
- Upload an MRI image for prediction.
- Backend processes the image and uses a ResNet model to classify the dementia stage.
- Frontend displays the prediction result in a user-friendly manner.

---

## Requirements
### **Backend: Flask**
- Python 3.8 or higher
- TensorFlow
- OpenCV
- Flask

### **Frontend: React**
- Node.js
- npm or yarn

---

## Installation and Setup

### **1. Clone the Repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/madelinechudy/cs588-capstone.git
cd mri-prediction-ui
```

---

### **2. Backend: Flask**

#### Navigate to the Backend Directory
```bash
cd src
```

#### Prepare the ResNet Model
1. Ensure the path to the model is correctly set in the `app.py` file. For example, the current model path for resnet_model.keras is:
   ```python
   model_path = "C:\Users\maddi\Documents\cs588-capstone\Segmentation\Models\ResNet\Classification\resnet_model.keras"
   ```
   Change this to match your path.

#### Run the Flask Server
```bash
py App.py
```

The server will start on `http://127.0.0.1:5000`.

#### Verify the Server
Visit the endpoint in your browser:
```
http://127.0.0.1:5000/
```
You should see a welcome message or a JSON response confirming the server is active.

---

### **3. Frontend: React**

#### Navigate to the Frontend Directory
```bash
cd mri-prediction-ui
```

#### Install Dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

#### Start the React App
```bash
npm start
```

The React app will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

---

Now your web application is ready to use. Upload an MRI scan via the React interface and view the predictions generated by the ResNet model!
